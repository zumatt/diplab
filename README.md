### The Experience
Thanks to the digitization of the antibiogram test, it is now possible to experience it outside of microbiology laboratories. This workshop offers participants an exciting opportunity to deepen their understanding of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. In addition, participants will have the chance to engage in a range of practical activities and learn about the test in a hands-on setting. This comprehensive workshop aims to help participants gain a deeper appreciation of the significance of antibiotics and the impact they have on our daily lives. By participating in this workshop, attendees will be able to broaden their knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, and explore the role of these life-saving drugs in modern medicine.

### Technicalities
The DiPLab Petri is based on the InkPlate 6 PLUS.
