# DiPLab - Digital Petri Laboratory

DiPLab is a project that is part of [MAKEAWARE!](https://spearhead-amr.github.io/makeaware/) , which aims to raise awareness about the issue of [Antibiotic Resistance](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antibiotic-resistance).

By digitizing the [antibiogram test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_sensitivity_testing), it is now possible to experience it outside of microbiology laboratories. This workshop provides an exciting opportunity for participants to deepen their understanding of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance. Additionally, participants will have the chance to engage in practical activities and learn about the test in a hands-on setting. This comprehensive workshop aims to help participants gain a deeper appreciation for the significance of antibiotics and their impact on daily life. By attending this workshop, participants will be able to broaden their knowledge of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance and explore the role of these life-saving drugs in modern medicine.

This repository contains the stable version of the DiPLab. In order to create your own digital petri you can download the source code and the 3D files from the releases.
